# Logging into AWS

* After you log in, make sure you're in the correct region (Ireland, eu-west-1).
  
## Cloud Reminders
On Azure...
* Only make what you are authorised to make
* Tag everything with the key Owner and value <your first name>
* Any .pem file must go in your .ssh folder (a private key when generated yourself doesn't have any extension)
* .ssh folder must NEVER be part of any Git repo. Why?
* Use UK South region only
* Working hours for Azure: 9:00 to 17:00. If you need to use after this time, ask your trainer well ahead of time.
* Switch off (“Stop”) VMs when you are not using them or by the end of working hours.
* Your responsibility: Remove anything you know you don’t need anymore.

On AWS...
* Similar rules apply except...
* You don't need to tag everything you make
* You need to use the Ireland region only
