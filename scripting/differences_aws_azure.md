# Differences between Azure and AWS

## When creating a VM.
* By default, in Azure, you get a static (fixed) public IP assigned to your VM.
* On AWS, by default, you will get a dynamic (changing) public IP assigned to the VM. 
  * When you stop and start the VM on AWS, the public IP address will change.
