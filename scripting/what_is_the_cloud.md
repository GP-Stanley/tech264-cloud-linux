# Understand what the cloud is

## How Do We Know if Something Is in the Cloud?
The cloud means storing and accessing data or programs over the internet, rather than your local hard drive. If you access a service via the web or through a remote server, itâ€™s in the cloud.
* Example: Using Google Drive for file storage vs. saving files directly on your computer.

## Differences Between On-Prem and Cloud
* `On-Premises`: Your business owns, maintains, and operates its own physical servers and infrastructure on-site.
  * *Advantages*: Full control, security, no third-party involvement.
  * *Disadvantages*: Expensive upfront costs, maintenance, scalability challenges.
* `Cloud`: Servers are hosted by a third party (like AWS or Azure) and are accessed via the internet.
  * *Advantages*: Lower upfront costs, scalable, maintenance-free for users.
  * Disadvantages: Less control, ongoing costs, dependency on the provider.
  
## 4 Cloud Deployment Models:
1. `Private Cloud`: Infrastructure is used exclusively by one organisation.
   * Use example: Highly secure environments.
2. `Public Cloud`: Services provided over the public internet and shared among users (e.g., AWS, Azure).
   * Use example: General businesses looking to scale easily.
3. `Hybrid Cloud`: A combination of both private and public clouds, offering more flexibility.
   * Use example: When businesses want to keep some sensitive data on-prem while using cloud for other tasks.
4. `Multi-Cloud`: Using multiple cloud providers for different services (e.g., AWS for storage, Azure for VMs).
   * Use example: Large businesses leveraging various strengths of cloud providers.

## Types of Cloud Services:
* `IaaS` (Infrastructure as a Service): Provides virtualized computing resources like virtual machines, storage, and networking. Example: AWS EC2.
* `PaaS` (Platform as a Service): Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications. Example: Microsoft Azure App Service.
* `SaaS` (Software as a Service): Software that is accessible via the internet. Example: Gmail, Dropbox.
  
## Cloud Advantages/Disadvantages (For Businesses)
Advantages:
* Cost-efficient (no need to maintain hardware).
* Scalable (can easily add more resources).
* Flexibility to access from anywhere.
* Disaster recovery is easier.

Disadvantages:
* Security concerns, especially for sensitive data.
* Downtime risks if the provider has issues.
* Ongoing operational costs.

## OpEx vs CapEx (Operational vs Capital Expenses)
  * CapEx (Capital Expenditure): Upfront investment in physical infrastructure, like buying servers. Used in on-prem environments.
  * OpEx (Operational Expenditure): Ongoing costs like paying for cloud services month-to-month. Used in cloud environments.
  * The cloud favors OpEx, making it easier to scale costs gradually rather than large upfront investments.

## Is Migrating to the Cloud Always Cheaper?
Not always. While cloud services reduce upfront costs, ongoing expenses (OpEx) may become higher over time, depending on the use case, especially for heavy, continuous workloads.

## Market Share of Cloud Providers:
* `AWS`: Dominates the market, known for its broad range of services, particularly IaaS and PaaS.
* `Microsoft Azure`: Second largest, integrates well with Microsoft products, popular for PaaS solutions.
* `Google Cloud`: Known for machine learning and big data analytics.

## Largest Cloud Providers' Strengths:
1. `AWS`: Wide variety of services, scalability, global reach.
2. `Azure`: Strong integration with Microsoft products (Office 365, Windows).
3. `Google Cloud`: Leading in data processing, AI, and analytics.

## Which Cloud Provider Is Best?
It depends on your needs:
* `AWS`: Best for diverse services and global reach.
* `Azure`: Best for Microsoft integration.
* `Google Cloud`: Best for data-heavy applications and AI.
  
## What Do You Pay for in the Cloud?
* `Storage`: Pay per GB of data.
* `Compute Power`: Charges based on CPU/RAM usage.
* `Networking`: Data transfer costs.
* `Additional Services`: Load balancers, databases, etc.

## 4 Pillars of DevOps in the Cloud:
* `Collaboration`: Cross-team collaboration is key in both cloud and DevOps.
* `Automation`: Cloud services enable automation for faster deployment.
* `Continuous Delivery`: The cloud allows continuous deployment of code.
* `Monitoring and Feedback`: Cloud services provide real-time feedback and monitoring tools.
